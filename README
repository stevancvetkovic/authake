MISacl is an authake-based authentication and authorization plugin for CakePHP 1.2.x. It was made for the purposes of Medical Information Systems course at Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Nis, Serbia. This specific branch adds support for authentication with SSL client certificates.

Features:
* registration with e-mail confirmation
* password resets by e-mail
* listing rules and users
* SSL client certificate authentication
* easy web management of users and rules

Requirements:
* CakePHP 1.2.x
* MySQL Server 5.x
* OpenSSL 0.98 or newer
* DNS server (BIND 9.x recommended)

Procedure of creating SSL CA, CSR, self-signing CSR and generating PKCS#12:
* Create a new folder and grab CA.pl that ships with OpenSSL
  cd ~
  mkdir ssl
  cd ssl
  cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ./
  cp /usr/lib/ssl/misc/CA.pl ./

* Create new Certification Authority:
  sudo perl CA.pl -newca

* Create new Certificate Signing Request:
  sudo perl CA.pl -newreq

* Self-sign CSR with CA created above:
  sudo perl CA.pl -signreq

* Create PKCS#12 file that can be imported to client web browser:
  sudo perl CA.pl -pkcs12 "Your Name"

* In order to prevent Apache asking for certificate password do the following:
  cp newkey.pem newkey.pem.org
  sudo openssl rsa -in newkey.pem.org -out newkey.pem
