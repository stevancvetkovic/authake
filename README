Authake is an authentication and authorization plugin for CakePHP 1.2.x. This specific branch adds support for authentication with SSL client certificates and it was made for the purposes of Medical Information Systems course at Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Nis, Serbia. 

Features:
* registration with e-mail confirmation
* password resets by e-mail
* listing rules and users
* SSL client certificate authentication
* SSL client certificates Web management
* easy web management of users and rules

Requirements:
* Apache Web server 2.2.x or newer
* MySQL Server 5.1.x
* CakePHP 1.2.x
* OpenSSL 0.98 or newer
* DNS server (BIND 9.x recommended)

Procedure of creating SSL CA, CSR, self-signing CSR and generating PKCS#12:
* Create a new folder and grab CA.pl that ships with OpenSSL
  cd ~
  mkdir ssl
  cd ssl
  cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ./
  cp /usr/lib/ssl/misc/CA.pl ./

* Create new Certification Authority:
  sudo perl CA.pl -newca

* Create new Certificate Signing Request:
  sudo perl CA.pl -newreq

* Self-sign CSR with CA created above:
  sudo perl CA.pl -signreq

* Create PKCS#12 file that can be imported to client web browser:
  sudo perl CA.pl -pkcs12 "Your Name"

* In order to prevent Apache asking for certificate password do the following:
  cp newkey.pem newkey.pem.org
  sudo openssl rsa -in newkey.pem.org -out newkey.pem
